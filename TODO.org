* DONE Write accessors for atom data type.
  Atoms are stored in two parallel arrays. The id array stores the ids, and the
  body array stores (pred, char) pairs. Ids are 64-bit (yarn, weft) pairs, and
  chars are 32-bit unsigned ints -- UTF-32, in other words. This allows for fast
  searching by id, with better memory locality than if we put all this in one
  array.

  The id array is a uint64_t array, and the body array is a uint32_t array with
  three times as many elements.

* DONE Write sequential accessors for atoms
  Just like regular accessors, but sequential.

* DONE Write weft data type. (weft_t)
  For this, use a JudyL array mapping yarns to maximum offsets. Judy arrays are
  usually pretty good about space-efficiency, so you shouldn't have to worry
  about this using a shit-ton of memory. The operations we need on a weft are:
** DONE Make empty weft. (new_weft)
** DONE Delete a weft. (delete_weft)
** DONE Print a weft. (weft_print)
** DONE Copy a weft. (copy_weft)
** DONE Get the top of a given yarn (weft_get)
** DONE Set the top of a given yarn (weft_set)
** DONE Extend a given yarn (weft_extend)
** DONE Does a weft cover a given atom id? (weft_covers)
** DONE Merge another weft into this one, modifying only this one. (weft_merge_into)

* DONE Write memoization dict data type. (memodict_t)
  This is a JudyL array of JudyL arrays. The outer array has yarns as keys; the
  inner array has offsets as keys. To look up an id in this monstrosity, here's
  the procedure:

  1. Look up the yarn. If it's not found, return an empty weft. Otherwise:
  2. Look up the offset or its earliest ancestor, using JLL to find the index,
     and JLG to get the associated weft. Neither of these should fail; if they
     do, then return an error code.
  3. Return a copy of this weft, extended to cover the current id. Hooray!

  To add a weft to the monstrosity:

  1. Look up the yarn. If it's not found, create a new JudyL array; call this
     array =inner=. Insert an (offset -> weft) mapping into =inner=, and insert
     (yarn -> =inner=) into the outer array. Return. OTHERWISE:
  2. Use JLI to ensure that there is a mapping of offset->weft. If there's
     already a weft at that position in the array, de-allocate it. Then set the
     pointer (from JLI) to point to the new weft.
  3. Return a success value! Hooray!

* DONE Write patch data type
   A patch is a collection of chains. Each chain is a sequence of atoms (in
   sequential format), consisting of a single type of atom: insertions,
   deletors, or save-awareness atoms. Each atom in an insertion chain must have
   the previous atom as its predecessor, except for the first one (the
   head). Every atom in a patch must be in the same yarn. Every atom in a patch
   (except for the head of the first chain) must have an offset one higher than
   the atom before it. No atom in a non-insertion chain, nor the head of an
   insertion chain, may have a predecessor in the patch. This has a few
   implications:

   1. You can determine the id range of a patch trivially. Call the yarn and
      offset of the head atom y0 and o0, and the length (in atoms) len. The ids
      in the patch range from (y0, o0) to (y0, o0 + len - 1).

   2. You can check the predecessors-outside-patch rule with a simple range
      check, once you've used property (1).

   The patch format is as follows:

   <length in bytes: uint32_t><number-of-chains: uint8_t>
   # Offsets in bytes, and lengths in atoms, of each chain. Offsets relative to
   # [MARK]. Can use this to calculate total length, in atoms.
   <chain1-offset-len: uint32_t, uint16_t>, <chain2-offset-len: uint32_t, uint16_t>, ...
   [MARK]<atoms of chain1><atoms of chain2> ...
   
* DONE Write waiting-set data type (waitingset_t)
  Waiting sets. Maps from ids to vectors of pointers to patches blocking on that
  id. Yeah, it's kind of irritatingly complicated.

  A vector is represented as an array of machine words, with the first one
  telling the size of the array (including the first two words), the second
  telling the number of array elements used by data, and the rest being the data
  itself. This can serve as an array of pointers, with amortized O(1) append. It
  must be freed with free() by the client code.

  The rest of the mapping is done with JudyL arrays.

** DONE Write function to get waiting set for an id, removing it from the dict.
   Removal *must* remove empty inner judys.
** DONE Write function to tell if waiting set is empty

* DONE Write vector weave data type (weave_t)
* TODO Write patch validation function. See your written notes for details.
* TODO Write patch insertion for vector weaves.
  First, check to see if the patch can be cleanly inserted. If the answer is no,
  stick it in the waiting set. Otherwise, continue.

  Build a two-level JudyL mapping from ids to delatoms, and another mapping
  from ids to structs containing a non-sticky chain pointer and its length.
** DONE Write apply_insvec to apply insertion vectors.
   An insertion vector is a vector_t of alternating index, chain_length, and
   chain* words. All indices are in ascending order.
*** DONE Write apply_insvec_alloc
*** DONE Write apply_insvec_inplace
* TODO Serialization for everything. In a stable format.
  Ponder this later.

* TODO Turn off Judy error handling, except for malloc failures.
  Method 2 in http://judy.sourceforge.net/doc/Judy_3x.htm#ERRORS

  Do this once your program is working stably.
